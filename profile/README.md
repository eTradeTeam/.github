## Our Process

1. **Idea Generation**  
   - **Evaluate Strategy Categories**  
     We begin by examining broad strategy types—such as **Trend Following**, **Breakout**, and **Mean Reversion**—to identify **subcategories of indicators** and signals that consistently contribute to successful strategies.  
   - **Systematic Indicator Analysis**  
     We then analyze, test, and refine each indicator (e.g., moving averages, momentum oscillators) to determine their suitability for different market conditions.  
   - **Combining Entry/Exit Signals**  
     Potential entry and exit rules are methodically combined to see which configurations yield robust performance across diverse data sets.

2. **Proof of Concept**  
   - Rapidly prototype strategies in backtesting environments using standard OHLC, volume, or tick data.  

3. **Validation & Stress Testing**  
   - Conduct multi-phase testing (including parameter sensitivity and cross-validation) to reduce overfitting.  

4. **Portfolio Construction**  
   - Combine uncorrelated strategies, balancing risk, return, and correlation metrics.  

5. **Live Implementation**  
   - Transition validated strategies to real accounts, continuously monitoring and optimizing.
