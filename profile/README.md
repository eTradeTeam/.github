### üîç Mission Statement
This Team is a collaborative community of students from Kevin Davey‚Äôs Strategy Factory Course working together to design, develop, and test automated trading strategies using modern tools, shared expertise, and disciplined trading principles.

Our mission is to accelerate the creation of high-quality, robust, and well-documented trading strategies while building a strong foundation in strategy development, money management, and AI-enhanced workflows.

### üß© Scope of Work

The team‚Äôs work is organized into several private and public GitHub repositories:

- **Framework Repository**: Shared codebase for reusable components (data handling, order execution, logging, etc.).
- **Money Management Repository**: Tools for position sizing, equity curve tracking, drawdown protection, etc.
- **GenAI Repository**: Prompts and methods for refining strategies using generative AI.
- **Public Overview Repository**: Documentation of team structure, strategy categories, and participation process.
